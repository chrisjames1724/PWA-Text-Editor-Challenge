# PWA-Text-Editor-Challenge

# Description
In this assignment we were given starter code of a text editor that had to run in the browser while meeting the PWA criteria. We were to make sure the webpack config file had everything it needed to run properly.  We were then supposed to add to the database.js file in order to add logic for the add and put methods.  in the src-service worker file we needed to add to the registerRoute in order to make sure the caching worked properly.
